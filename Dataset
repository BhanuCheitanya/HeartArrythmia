# About the dataset
This dataset is composed of two collections of heartbeat signals derived from two famous
datasets in heartbeat classification, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic
ECG Database. The number of samples in both collections is large enough for training a deep
neural network.
The dataset considered for this case is Cardiac Arrhythmia Database. The dataset consists of
549 instances and 290 associated subjects. The dataset classifies 16 different heart conditions
ranging from Premature Contraction to Blockage which are directly associated with Heart
Arrythmia. The dataset also consists information regarding the Gender of the patient along with
other personal details like weight, height, age etc.
This dataset has been used in exploring heartbeat classification using deep neural network
architectures, and observing some of the capabilities of transfer learning on it. The signals
correspond to electrocardiogram (ECG) shapes of heartbeats for the normal case and the cases
affected by different arrhythmias and myocardial infarction. These signals are preprocessed
and segmented, with each segment corresponding to a heartbeat.
The dataset is in the form of .csv files, and contains data from two datasets-MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database.
The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset has 109,500 samples with 5 categories/classes. These

classes are 'N': 0, 'S': 1, 'V': 2, 'F': 3, 'Q': 4 and these stand for-
0: 'Normal Beat',

1: 'Supraventricular premature beat',
2: 'Premature ventricular contraction',
3: 'Fusion beats',
4: 'Unclassifiable/Unknown beats'.
The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database contains around 14,500 samples and 2 categories/classes.
This dataset contains information related to height, weight, gender and age of patients.


Since the dataset is huge the .csv files cannot be uploaded to github directly. Hence I am attaching a drive link from where one can access the datasets.
